A slightly modified version of Solarized for Vim
------------------------------------------------

There was a bug concerning italics, it checked the $TERM_PROGRAM environment variable, which is not available on Linux (it has $TERM instead).

The original conditional was replaced with the patch from 
https://github.com/altercation/vim-colors-solarized/issues/120.
